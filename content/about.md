Welcome to The Woman in the Garage! I created this page as a home for women in STEM who one day hope to work in motorsports. With the rise of popularity in motorsports in the last years, there are tons of rescources for fans to learn about drives, team principals, and the latest trends in the paddock. I wanted to create a space to learn and stay up to date on the engineering side of motorsports! So, welcome, I hope my journey into the motrosports world inspires you to chase your dreams. You never know what one opportunity can lead to.
